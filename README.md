# Castle-Black
Active Directory Pentesting
CastleBlack meant to demonstrate a vulnerable domain controller without proper hardening. It is a good place to start Internal penetration testing as I'm going to cover most commonly attack types used by adversaries to penetrate AD environment. Episode one is all about the basic setups and Lab preparation.
Hope you enjoy this.
